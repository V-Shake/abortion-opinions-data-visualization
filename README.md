# Abortion Opinions Visualization (GSS Data)

**This project was developed during our course *3-dim. Grundlagen im medialen Raum* in the 3rd semester at HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd. The data visualization showcases our work during three weeks.**

## About

In this project, we explored how various factors influence public opinion on the legalization of abortion in the United States. Using historical survey data, we visualized how opinions have shifted between 1977 and 2018.

## Dataset

We used data from the [General Social Survey (GSS)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/abortion-opinions-in-the-general-social-survey/data), which provides demographic information about respondents – such as age, gender, education, and political orientation – alongside their views on abortion under different circumstances. These include situations like rape, fetal deformity, financial hardship, or not wanting more children. Additional context factors such as the woman's economic status or social environment were also included.

## Goal

Our main goal was to create a meaningful and accessible data visualization that communicates the complex relationships between personal demographics and views on abortion. The result is a visual representation of evolving public sentiment across four decades in the U.S.
